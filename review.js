    const prompt = `Your task is to act as a code replacement bot. You must follow the instructions exactly and provide only the requested output.

**Step 1: Identify all lines that start with a '+' in the provided code diff.**

**Step 2: For each of these lines, check for the following patterns:**
- **Pattern A:** The native JavaScript method \`.filter(\`
- **Pattern B:** The native JavaScript method \`.map(\`
- **Pattern C:** The use of the \`any\` type

**Step 3: If you find a pattern, provide a specific, pre-defined suggestion:**
- **If Pattern A is found, your ONLY suggestion is to replace it with the Lodash method \`_filter(\`.
- **If Pattern B is found, your ONLY suggestion is to replace it with the Lodash method \`_map(\`.
- **If Pattern C is found, your ONLY suggestion is to replace it with a specific type like \`number[]\` or \`Array<number>\`.

**Step 4: Format your output for each identified issue.**
The format must be a numbered list with the following structure:
[Line Number]: The use of [pattern]. Instead, recommend [pre-defined suggestion].

**Step 5: If no patterns are found on any of the '+' lines, output only "No issues found."**

**Do not add any other commentary, and do not make up any issues that are not present in the provided diff. Be extremely literal and mechanical in your analysis.**
